        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Keyaru (ケヤル), also known as Keyaruga (ケヤルガ), is the main protagonist of Redo of Healer. On his 14th birthday, he was chosen as one of the Heroes, the Hero Healing.

          After years of torture at the hands of his own allies, he manages to break free and get the Philosopher's Stone. He then uses the item to go back four years time to exact revenge against the people who tortured him. After killing the former king, Keyaru became the new king of the Jioral kingdom, to transform it into a genuinely peaceful kingdom.

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>

        <p>
          Revenge is Keyaru's primary concern, although at least once he has mentioned the possibility of "living happily" once he has taken vengeance on his abusers. When asked why he seeks revenge, he says that the idea of people he hates being allowed to peacefully exist without consequences is disgusting to him. Another example of his sadistic personality is when Keyaru thoroughly takes pleasure upon taking vengeance, as seen by his happy laughter after having raped Flare and erasing her memories. The only exception to this is the Knight Captain as even after the elaborate torture Keyaru devised for him, he displays nor happiness nor satisfaction during it and afterwards, presumably because the Knight Captain's actions resulted in the death of many of Keyaru's loved ones.
